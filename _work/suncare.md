## How do you create a brand that puts people first? 
### The answer is simple really, by putting their needs above your own. Suncare came to VA in need of a brand refresh and a new, updated website. The website would need to connect clients to their services with minimum effort. Whilst the brand needed to convey and resonate their core offering - Care.  Both would have to have convey Suncare’s 40-year history and maintain their organisation's ethos - ‘Make People’s Lives Better’"
